### Hi there, I am Duygu ðŸ‘‹

I am a master's student in Project Managament and Data science in Berlin.

I am a solution-oriented design and business professional with a comprehensive background and experience in design, project and 
application management in a broad spectrum of industries. Believes in multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving and optimization 
through hybrid methods that combine qualitative and quantitative information with a focus not only on questions of â€˜what?â€™ but also on the 
reasons behind the data with a focus on questions of â€˜why?â€™ Builds upon the combination of different methods that vary from design-thinking 
to data driven decision-making.

ðŸ”­ I am working on Machine Learning projects - application of Keras, NLTK, Pytorch, Transformers, Tensorflow.
