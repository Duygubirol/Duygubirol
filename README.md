### Hi there, I am Duygu ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m a passionate Data Scientist dedicated to merging Design Thinking with Data Science to democratize Artificial Intelligence. With extensive experience in design, project, and application management across various industries, I advocate for a multi-disciplinary approach to problem-solving. My focus is on creating ethically responsible, technically advanced solutions that prioritize transparency, fairness, and inclusivity. I strive to lead in leveraging AIâ€™s transformative power through hybrid methods that combine qualitative insights and quantitative data, delving into not just 'what' but also 'why'.


ðŸ”­ I am working on Machine Learning projects - application of Keras, NLTK, Pytorch, Transformers, Tensorflow.
